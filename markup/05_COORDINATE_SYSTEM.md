## THE GEOMETRIC FRAMING // 01

The system is geometric: artifacts are points in a constrained space, not items in a single workflow. A small coordinate system makes constraints explicit and composable. Coordinates are routing metadata: they decide which template applies, what evidence is required, what tone is permitted, what can be imported, and what kind of acceptance test closes the loop. Declare coordinates at the top of durable artifacts, explicitly. This reduces argument about what kind of thing an artifact is and prevents category collapse -- treating a draft as a binding spec, or an internal note as an external communication.

## THE AXES

### Authority

What governance weight does this artifact carry? Values range from draft (provisional, not yet ratified), through local rule (binding within a project scope), to spec (binding across the corpus). Authority determines how much process is required to change the artifact and what downstream artifacts depend on it.

### Audience

Who is the artifact for? Internal artifacts serve the operator and the corpus itself. External artifacts are addressed to recipients outside the corpus boundary. The audience axis determines tone, formality, assumed context, and what can be left implicit.

### Verification

How is the artifact checked? Values include checklist (pass/fail against enumerated criteria), evidence-bound (claims must trace to sources), citation-required (external references mandatory), formal template check (structural compliance only), and external termination (the artifact is verified by the response it produces in the world).

### Context source

What information may the artifact draw on? Corpus anchors restrict to material already in the governed corpus. Corpus plus cited sources allows external material provided it is explicitly referenced. Model prior plus explicit sources permits the runtime's general knowledge but requires that non-corpus claims be marked.

### Time horizon

How long must the artifact remain useful? Ephemeral artifacts are single-use. Session-scoped artifacts persist for the duration of a work session. Durable artifacts must survive across sessions, model changes, and context loss. The time horizon determines maintenance obligations and signage requirements.

### Governance cost

How much process overhead does the artifact justify? Untyped artifacts carry no governance -- raw captures, scratch notes. Lightly typed artifacts follow templates but skip formal verification. Strongly typed artifacts require full coordinate declaration, verification, and signage. The cost axis prevents over-governance of low-stakes material and under-governance of high-stakes material.

## SECOND-ORDER MODIFICATION

The coordinate system is itself subject to modification through second-order writing. The operator can add axes when new routing distinctions are needed, tighten existing axes when categories are too broad, or remove axes when they create overhead without routing power. The coordinate system is part of the governed corpus and changes to it follow the same governance procedures as any other spec-level artifact.

## USAGE EXAMPLE // 04

A decision record with traceable trade-offs might declare: Authority=spec; Audience=internal; Verification=evidence-bound; Context=corpus plus cited sources; Time horizon=durable; Governance=strongly typed. These coordinates route the artifact to the appropriate template, require claims to trace to sources, mandate signage for long-term integrity, and ensure changes require the full governance process.

## CORPUS INDEX

The corpus comprises three layers: a first-order introduction for human readers, a second-order runtime instruction for machine interpreters, and the protocol specification itself. The documents are listed below with their function and layer.

- CORPUS_MANIFEST: Layer: Meta. This document. Index, versioning, license.
- PROTOCOL_INTRODUCTION: Layer: First-order. Human-readable front door to the protocol.
- EXPLAINED_RUNTIME: Layer: Second-order. Read-only runtime instructions for LLM interpreters.
- STRUCTURAL_OBLIGATIONS: Layer: Protocol spec. The six structural obligations for corpus portability.
- COORDINATE_SYSTEM: Layer: Protocol spec. Artifact routing metadata and the coordinate axes.
- EPISTEMIC_GOVERNANCE: Layer: Protocol spec. The roman/italic convention for epistemic status.
- INTRINSIC_SIGNAGE: Layer: Protocol spec. Content-derived verification through style variation.
- TERSE_STYLE: Layer: Protocol spec. The terse style system: prose density and dial families.
- DESIGN_LANGUAGE: Layer: Protocol spec. Visual compilation rules for PDF projection.

## VERSIONING

This is version 1.0 of the Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol, dated February 2026. The protocol is maintained as a governed corpus: changes require explicit patches with insertion points, rationale, and operator ratification. No silent changes. Version history is tracked through the corpus manifest; each revision carries a date and a summary of what changed. The protocol is designed for stability. Changes to structural obligations, the coordinate system, or intrinsic signage require regression checks against existing governed artifacts. Changes to style rules or design language may be extended without regression provided new rules do not conflict with existing dial families.

## SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES // 04

The protocol governs the structure, verification, and governance of text artifacts produced through language model runtimes. It does not govern the content of those artifacts. It provides conventions for portability, integrity, and epistemic transparency; it does not provide opinions, recommendations, or domain-specific knowledge. The protocol is not a product, a service, or a platform. It is a specification that any competent runtime can implement. Vendor independence is a design requirement, not an aspiration.

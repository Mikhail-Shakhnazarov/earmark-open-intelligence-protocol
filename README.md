# Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol

**Version 1.0** | Berlin, February 2026

## Introduction (a readme for the readme), a note from the author:

This project is built **for collaboration**. The Open Intelligence Protocol is an open, evolving framework -- dive in, contribute, and help shape how we think about machine-intelligible systems. This is not a commercial product. It is a public demonstration of a practice that can be offered commercially. The ideas described here cannot be copyrighted; the specification text itself is licensed under **CC BY-SA 4.0**.

**Author's suggestion for human readers:**

The language is dense, terse and obtuse because this protocol is written in the language it defines (it's a text about text that explains, how it works). For opzimal experience, load it into an LLM and have the LLM interpret :)

**00** **THE INTELLIGENCE IS LANGUAGE** explains the thinking
**01** **CORPUS MANIFEST** explains the structure
**02** **PROTOCOL INTRODUCTION** explains the protocol

After that, if you want to experience it differently, load the complete corpus into NotebookLM or a similar tool and let the system analyze its own logic. You'll see how the protocol becomes a lens through which the lens itself can be understood. It's meta, and it works. Let the chatbot explain it. Ask questions. Be maximally curious if you want to. This is version 1 -- a proof by demonstration.

For current project needs, and to see how you can contribute, contact me. It's also good enough to simply go build something on your own. So do that -- and let's talk.

I want to stress something buried in the Introduction:

> The protocol serves anyone who needs language model output to be reliable, verifiable, and accumulative rather than disposable. This includes individual practitioners maintaining personal knowledge systems, teams that need consistent governed output across members and tools, and developers building applications that require structured, verifiable text generation.
> The protocol does not require specialized technical knowledge beyond literacy and the willingness to maintain structured text. The skill is teachable. The tools are available.
> The barrier is conceptual, not technical: the belief that structural thinking about one's own knowledge requires institutional support. It does not. The public library, not the scholar's study, is the historical parallel.

## Overview

The **Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol** is a formal specification for structuring, verifying, and governing machine-intelligible systems. This repository contains the complete protocol specification as a series of conceptual and technical documents, designed to serve as both a reference implementation and a durable publication surface.

The protocol establishes a framework for:

* **Corpus Manifestation:** Defining language as the primary substrate of intelligence.
* **Structural Obligations:** Six requirements for corpus portability and durability.
* **Epistemic Governance:** The Roman/Italic convention for knowledge status.
* **Intrinsic Signage:** Content-derived verification through style variation.

## Contents

The protocol specification consists of the following primary documents (Markdown):

1. **00_THE_INTELLIGENCE_IS_LANGUAGE.md** -- Thesis: Language as the execution substrate.
2. **01_CORPUS_MANIFEST.md** -- Index, versioning, and license declaration.
3. **02_PROTOCOL_INTRODUCTION.md** -- Orientation and core problem statement.
4. **03_EXPLAINED_RUNTIME.md** -- Instructions for read-only interpretation and verification.
5. **04_STRUCTURAL_OBLIGATIONS.md** -- The six requirements for corpus portability.
6. **05_COORDINATE_SYSTEM.md** -- Artifact routing metadata and geometric framing.
7. **06_EPISTEMIC_GOVERNANCE.md** -- The Roman/Italic convention and promotion rules.
8. **07_INTRINSIC_SIGNAGE.md** -- Style-based verification and drift detection.
9. **07a_INTRINSIC_SIGNAGE_ADDENDUM.md** -- Industry use cases and standards positioning.
10. **08_TERSE_STYLE.md** -- Prose density, punctuation control, and dial families.

## Trademarks

`EARMARK MACHINES FOR THINKING` is a trademark (TM) of Mikhail Shakhnazarov.

This repository is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 for the protocol text. The license does not grant any rights in the trademark.

Nominative reference is permitted (e.g., "compatible with the Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol") provided it does not imply sponsorship, endorsement, or an official relationship.

Fork rule: Derivative protocol copies and forks must use a distinct project name and must not present `EARMARK MACHINES FOR THINKING` (or `EARMARK` / `MACHINES FOR THINKING`) as the product or organization name.

Wordmark lockup rule: When rendered as a two-line mark, line 1 MUST be `EARMARK` and line 2 MUST be `MACHINES FOR THINKING`. The tagline MUST be letterspaced so its rendered width matches the rendered width of `EARMARK` exactly, independent of font size.

Crypto/tokens boundary: This project will never issue, sell, or promote a cryptocurrency or token. Blockchain may be explored only as an infrastructure primitive (e.g., integrity, provenance, distributed coordination), not as a financial product.

## How to Use This Repository
* **For reading:** Access the Markdown files directly through GitHub's file viewer for optimized rendering of the protocol's structural formatting.
* **For reference:** Refer to the **Structural Obligations (04)** as a normative guide when building systems that implement the protocol.
* **For execution:** Provide **03_EXPLAINED_RUNTIME.md** to a language model to configure it as a protocol-aware interpreter.

## Version and Maintenance

This is the **initial release (v1.0)** of the Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol. The specification is maintained as a governed corpus; changes require explicit patches and operator ratification.

## OUTRO, a postscriptum from the author:

This corpus can be read directly (though it is dense, because the language is highly optimized for parsing), or you can load it into an LLM's context window. The LLM reads it all at once and interprets within the bounds set by the text itself -- without my intervention. This is a communication medium. It is **a reverse echo chamber**, and it must be treated as such. It does not speak for me, in my voice, or on my behalf. It simply explains what the texts mean.

You cannot stack LLMs on top of each other indefinitely. They **will** hallucinate and lose reference between what is true and what is merely discussion because a context window is a bounded token buffer. Without governance, it becomes soup. Governance requires a termination point, and that point must be human because otherwise, we cannot evaluate the resolution. **A system that produces outputs but cannot evaluate them is a combinatorial engine, not a knowledge system.**

This technology and practice stack scales in parallel. Human beings can cooperate. This is a literacy, and with literacy comes a proper Enlightenment.

Regarding the practice: I believe LLMs can be used as reflection tools -- to think, to cognate, perhaps -- under the right conditions. I do not want to reduce this to a technical protocol for the tech industry. This is a medium, and the first message in this medium is the medium itself.

The plain text is the author's text. The generated text is the execution of the author's text by a runtime. This corpus explains itself.

**P.P.S.** (Crypto / tokens): This project will never issue, sell, or promote a cryptocurrency or token. Blockchain may be explored only as an infrastructure primitive (e.g., integrity, provenance, distributed coordination), not as a financial product. This boundary is deliberate: it protects the medium from incentive capture.

Best,

-- Mikhail

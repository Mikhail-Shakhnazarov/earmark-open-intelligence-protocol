# Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol

**Version 1.0** | Berlin, February 2026

## Introduction (a readme for the readme), a note from the author:

This project is built **for collaboration**. The Open Intelligence Protocol is an open, evolving framework — dive in, contribute, and help shape how we think about machine-intelligible systems. This is not a commercial product. It is a demonstration of a commercial practice (coming soon, etc.), and one **cannot copyright an idea**.

**Author’s suggestion for human readers:** 01_DARK is preferred. 02_LIGHT is for daylight — it will hurt your eyes. Start with 01, the Manifest (it’s a table of contents), then read 02, the Introduction for humans. After that, if you want to experience it differently, load the complete corpus into NotebookLM or a similar tool and let the system analyze its own logic. You’ll see how the protocol becomes a lens through which the lens itself can be understood. It’s meta, and it works. Let the chatbot explain it. Ask questions. Be maximally curious if you want to. This is version 1 — a proof by demonstration.

For current project needs, and to see how you can contribute, contact me. It’s also good enough to simply go build something on your own. So do that — and let’s talk.

I want to stress something burried in section 5:

> The protocol serves anyone who needs language model output to be reliable, verifiable, and accumulative rather than disposable. This includes individual practitioners maintaining personal knowledge systems, teams that need consistent governed output across members and tools, and developers building applications that require structured, verifiable text generation.
>
> The protocol does not require specialized technical knowledge beyond literacy and the willingness to maintain structured text. The skill is teachable. The tools are available.
>
> The barrier is conceptual, not technical: the belief that structural thinking about one's own knowledge requires institutional support. It does not. The public library, not the scholar's study, is the historical parallel.


## Overview

The **Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol** is a formal specification for structuring, verifying, and governing machine-intelligible systems. This repository contains the complete protocol specification as a series of conceptual and technical documents, designed to serve as both a reference implementation and a durable publication surface.

The protocol establishes a framework for:
- Corpus manifestation and semantic integrity
- Runtime explanation and structural obligations
- Coordinate systems for epistemic governance
- Signage standards and design language principles

## Contents

The protocol specification consists of eight primary documents:

1. **./01_CORPUS_MANIFEST.pdf** — Foundational concepts and corpus structure
2. **./02_PROTOCOL_INTRODUCTION.pdf** — Protocol overview and core principles
3. **./03_EXPLAINED_RUNTIME.pdf** — Runtime behavior and operational semantics
4. **./04_STRUCTURAL_OBLIGATIONS.pdf** — Structural requirements and constraints
5. **./05_COORDINATE_SYSTEM.pdf** — Spatial and logical coordinate frameworks
6. **./06_EPISTEMIC_GOVERNANCE.pdf** — Knowledge representation and governance
7. **./07_INTRINSIC_SIGNAGE.pdf** — Marking and annotation standards
8. **./08_TERSE_STYLE.pdf** — Specification style and documentation norms

# Earmark Open Intelligence Protocol

**Version 1.0 — February 2026**

A comprehensive specification for epistemic governance, semantic coordination, and runtime verification in open-source intelligence systems. This protocol document set establishes normative structures for transparent reasoning, artifact attestation, and collaborative knowledge production.

## Overview

The Earmark Protocol defines:
- **Epistemic obligations** for agents and systems in knowledge coordination
- **Structural rules** for reasoning transparency and auditability  
- **Runtime verification** methods for integrity and consistency
- **Semantic layers** for unambiguous communication across heterogeneous systems
- **Design principles** for scalable, durable intelligence infrastructure

This is a **publication-grade specification**, suitable for:
- Academic citation and peer review
- Regulatory documentation and compliance frameworks
- Implementation guides for protocol-compliant systems
- Foundational theory in applied epistemology

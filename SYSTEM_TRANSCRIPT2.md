The transformer architecture stack is a system that produces outputs, based on input plus current context contents. It is not a system that can evaluate its own outputs. It is a system that can evaluate the outputs of another system, and that system, or one further down the line, will need to terminate the evaluation process. That system will need to provide a termination point, and that system must be human because otherwise, we cannot evaluate the resolution. Said simply, a system that produces outputs but cannot evaluate them is a combinatorial engine, not a knowledge system. Correlation also does not equal causation, and a combinatorial engine cannot reliably distinguish between the two on its own terms because it can't evaluate its own output. Therefore a closed-box AI is Schrödinger-insane: simultaneously coherent and incoherent until external verification collapses the uncertainty.

**RUNTIME:**

A transformer model is, at its core, a machine for producing text: it takes an input, mixes it with whatever sits in its current context window, and generates the next token. That is already a powerful capability, but it’s also a limitation. Generation is not the same thing as judgment. The system can _sound_ decisive without having any internal mechanism that settles whether what it produced is correct.

People often respond: “But it can critique itself.” It can produce _another_ output that looks like a critique, yes. But that’s still generation. If you ask the model to evaluate its own answer, you’ve just created a second round of text production about the first. If you then ask it to evaluate the evaluation, you get a third, and so on. You can build chains—model A critiques model B, model C critiques them both—but at some point the loop has to stop. Someone has to decide that the process has terminated and that the resolution is acceptable. In practice, that terminating authority has to be human, because otherwise there is no final court of appeal—only more text about text.

This matters because a system that can produce outputs but cannot _ground_ them in a resolved standard of correctness is not a knowledge system in the ordinary sense. It is a combinatorial engine: extremely good at assembling plausible continuations from patterns, extremely bad at knowing when “plausible” quietly diverges from “true.” And the classic warning—correlation is not causation—lands here with special force. Pattern engines are built to track correlations; causation requires an additional discipline: tests, interventions, provenance, and commitments about what would change one’s mind. Without those, the engine can’t reliably tell the difference between “these things co-occur in my training data” and “this is how the world works.”

That is why a closed-box AI can feel, from the outside, like a Schrödinger object: simultaneously coherent and incoherent until external verification collapses the uncertainty. The sentence reads well either way. The question is not whether the model can _talk_ as if it knows—it can. The question is whether the surrounding system provides the audits, checks, and termination points that turn fluent output into accountable knowledge.

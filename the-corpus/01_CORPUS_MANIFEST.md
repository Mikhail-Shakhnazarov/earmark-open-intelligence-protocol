This license covers the protocol specification documents listed below. Content produced using the protocol — operator-authored artifacts governed by these conventions — is not covered and may carry whatever license the producing operator chooses. The protocol enables sovereignty; the protocol itself is sovereign to no one.

## CORPUS INDEX // 02

The corpus comprises four layers: a thesis for public argument, a first-order introduction for human readers, a second-order runtime instruction for machine interpreters, and the protocol specification itself.

- THE_INTELLIGENCE_IS_LANGUAGE: Layer: Thesis. The public argument: language as intelligence substrate, governance as design parameter.
- CORPUS_MANIFEST: Layer: Meta. This document. Index, versioning, license.
- PROTOCOL_INTRODUCTION: Layer: First-order. Human-readable front door.
- EXPLAINED_RUNTIME: Layer: Second-order. Read-only runtime instructions for LLM interpreters.
- STRUCTURAL_OBLIGATIONS: Layer: Protocol spec. The six structural obligations for corpus portability.
- COORDINATE_SYSTEM: Layer: Protocol spec. Artifact routing metadata and coordinate axes.
- EPISTEMIC_GOVERNANCE: Layer: Protocol spec. The roman/italic convention for epistemic status.
- INTRINSIC_SIGNAGE: Layer: Protocol spec. Content-derived verification through style variation.
- INTRINSIC_SIGNAGE_ADDENDUM: Layer: First-order. Industry-facing explanation: use cases, conformance levels, standards positioning.
- TERSE_STYLE: Layer: Protocol spec. Prose density and dial families.

## VERSIONING // 03

Version 1.0, February 2026. The protocol is maintained as a governed corpus: changes require explicit patches with insertion points, rationale, and operator ratification. No silent changes. Version history is tracked through this manifest; each revision carries a date and change summary. Changes to structural obligations, the coordinate system, or intrinsic signage require regression checks against existing governed artifacts. Style rules may be extended without regression provided new rules do not conflict with existing dial families.

## SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES // 04

The protocol governs the structure, verification, and governance of text artifacts produced through language model runtimes; it does not govern content. It provides conventions for portability, integrity, and epistemic transparency without providing opinions, recommendations, or domain-specific knowledge. The protocol is a specification that any competent runtime can implement. Vendor independence is a design requirement.

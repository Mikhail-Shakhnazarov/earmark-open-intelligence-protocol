## THE GEOMETRIC FRAMING // 01

The system is geometric: artifacts are points in a constrained space, not items in a single workflow. A small coordinate system makes constraints explicit and composable. Coordinates are routing metadata — they decide which template applies, what evidence is required, what tone is permitted, what can be imported, and what acceptance test closes the loop. Declare coordinates at the top of durable artifacts, explicitly; this reduces argument about what kind of thing an artifact is and prevents category collapse (treating a draft as a binding spec, or an internal note as an external communication).

## THE AXES // 02

**Authority** governs the artifact's weight: draft (provisional, not yet ratified), local rule (binding within a project scope), or spec (binding across the corpus). Authority determines how much process is required to change the artifact and what downstream artifacts depend on it.

**Audience** determines address: internal artifacts serve the operator and the corpus itself; external artifacts are addressed to recipients outside the corpus boundary. The axis sets tone, formality, assumed context, and what can be left implicit.

**Verification** specifies the checking mode: checklist (pass/fail against enumerated criteria), evidence-bound (claims trace to sources), citation-required (external references mandatory), formal template check (structural compliance only), or external termination (verified by the response the artifact produces in the world).

**Context source** constrains permissible inputs: corpus-anchored (restricted to governed material), corpus plus cited sources (external material allowed if explicitly referenced), or model prior plus explicit sources (runtime general knowledge permitted but non-corpus claims must be marked).

**Time horizon** sets maintenance obligations: ephemeral (single-use), session-scoped (persists for the duration of a work session), or durable (survives across sessions, model changes, and context loss). Durable artifacts require signage.

**Governance cost** calibrates process overhead: untyped (no governance — raw captures, scratch notes), lightly typed (templates without formal verification), or strongly typed (full coordinate declaration, verification, and signage). The axis prevents over-governance of low-stakes material and under-governance of high-stakes material.

## SECOND-ORDER MODIFICATION // 03

The coordinate system is itself subject to modification through second-order writing. The operator can add axes when new routing distinctions are needed, tighten existing axes when categories are too broad, or remove axes when they create overhead without routing power. Changes follow the same governance procedures as any spec-level artifact.

## USAGE EXAMPLE // 04

A decision record with traceable trade-offs might declare: Authority=spec; Audience=internal; Verification=evidence-bound; Context=corpus plus cited sources; Time horizon=durable; Governance=strongly typed. These coordinates route the artifact to the appropriate template, require claims to trace to sources, mandate signage for long-term integrity, and ensure changes require the full governance process.

## THE CONVENTION // 01

The roman/italic convention is a minimal governance system that makes epistemic status visible without heavy process. Two typographic states carry governance meaning: roman text is compiled output — binding within the corpus, ratified by the operator, subject to verification; italic text is commentary — assumptions, uncertainty, missing evidence, candidate improvements, and provisional material not yet resolved. The convention exploits an existing typographic distinction to carry structural information; no new notation is required; any text system supporting roman and italic rendering can implement it. Overhead is near zero; governance value is high.

## THE PROMOTION RULE // 02

Italics do not become binding by inertia. Promotion from italic to roman requires resolution: a decision, a test, or an imported piece of evidence — this creates a stable place to hold uncertainty without either deleting it or pretending it is settled. The operator decides when promotion occurs; no automated process can promote italic to roman. This is the termination principle: governance decisions require human authority. The convention makes the decision legible and cheap (changing a typographic style is trivial) but the decision itself must be explicit.

## THE COMMENTARY LAYER // 03

Every artifact can carry an embedded commentary layer distinguished only by typographic status — not a separate document but italic annotations that travel with the artifact, making the system self-debugging. Later work can see what was assumed, what was weak, and what should be improved without reconstructing history. Commentary addresses: assumptions underpinning claims; evidence gaps requiring resolution; alternative interpretations considered but not adopted; revision triggers that would justify re-opening settled content; and dependencies on external facts that may change.

## DERIVATION MARKINGS // 04

Within both roman and italic text, claims carry derivation markings indicating epistemic source. Stated: content extracted directly from an identified source. Inferred: content derived from evidence through reasoning. Assumed: content adopted without direct evidence, typically for operational convenience. Derivation markings make provenance tractable without requiring full citation for every sentence.

## INTERACTION WITH SIGNAGE // 05

The roman/italic distinction interacts with intrinsic signage through the dial family mechanism. Roman (ratified) text uses the full terse style dial family and is signed on ratification; italic (provisional) text uses a different dial family or remains unsigned. The signage system can therefore detect not only whether text has changed but whether its epistemic status has been altered without proper promotion.

## FAILURE MODES // 06

Layer collapse: italic becomes rhetorical decoration rather than epistemic status; the system loses its cheapest drift-control mechanism. Promotion by inertia: provisional content hardens into canon because it was never explicitly reviewed; drafts treated as final because they look clean. Commentary bloat: italic annotations accumulate without resolution, the commentary layer becomes noise; periodic review and resolution are required. Missing derivation markings: claims appear in roman text without provenance; later readers cannot assess reliability; derivation markings are not optional for durable artifacts.
